** DESCRIPTION:

MHC is designed to help those who receive most appointments via email.
Using MHC, you can easily import schedule articles from emails.

You can get the latest version from:
 http://www.quickhack.net/mhc/

MHC has following features:

+ Easy import your schedule from email articles.
  Using with Mew/Gnus/Wanderlust (MUAs on Emacs),
  you can easily compose your schedule items from
  appoint-emails. MHC will guess the title,
  date, time and description by scanning the email.

+ Simple data structure allows you to manipulate stored data in many ways.
+ Both UNIX and Windows support.
+ Appointments can be made to repeat in flexible ways.
+ powerful but simple expression of appointments.
  Each appointment can have following attributes:

    date, subject, start/end time(not mandatory),
    advance time of alarm,
    multiple categories,
    recurrence rules,
    duration of the recurrence,
    list of exception dates,
    list of extra dates
    description.

+ Multiple user interfaces such as commandline/emacs/GUI/Web.
  MHC currently has following interfaces:

    + Elisp package cooperative with  Mew, Wanderlust or Gnus
        (popular MUA in the Emacs world)
        (emacs/mhc.el)
    + GUI (Ruby/Gtk based) desktop calendar application. (gemcal)
    + CGI based Web interface
        (not in this package please see http://mhc.hauN.org/web-mhc/)
    + Command line schedule lister like the scan of MH. (today)

MHC stores schedule articles in the same form of MH; you can manipulate
these messages not only by above tools but also by many other MUAs,
editors, UNIX commandline tools or your own scripts.
